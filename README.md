# General Acoustic Fields and Forces

## Mission statement
This open source project is for Mathematica implementations of acoustical fields and forces. It relies on the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory (GLMT) and the Stress tensor approach. Other contributions towards writing this code in R, Python, and other programming languages are welcomed.
